      "The meeting basically discussed the crisis across Canada amidst the pandemic. The opposition party questioned the ministers for responding late to the situation, and the financial support was not given to those who were really in need. The ministers promised that they were trying to reach out to as many companies as possible and the opposition party was not very satisfied with the answer. Canada's economy was heavily stricken by the pandemic and the opposition party was prompting the ministers to roll out several measures. Last but not least, they stressed on the long-term care issue, and the ministers promised that they were paying attention to it."

      "In response to the opposition party, the Prime Minister answered that the government rolled out the Canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly, and they had been helping the small businesses with the Canada emergency business account. The opposition party was not very satisfied because he thought that the government did not reach out to as many businesses as possible. Also, the opposition party made a few comments on the rent relief program which was too rigid and hard to apply."
